# Image-stegnography

The Image Steganography project is a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) application written in python, that enables users to hide and retrieve text-based information within digital images using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) substitution method. 
Through this application, users can seamlessly encode text messages into various image formats, such as PNG and JPEG, without perceptible alterations to the images. The encoded images can later be decoded to retrieve the hidden data. 
The project aims to provide a simple and effective solution for secure communication and data concealment within the realm of digital imagery, catering to users seeking to explore the intriguing world of steganography.
